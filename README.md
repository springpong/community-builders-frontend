# community-builders-frontend
Community Builders is a web application supported by JavaScript React that supports Outreach Programs by providing a platform where they can post upcoming events that need hands on deck and volunteers alike can search for events in their area and sign up to assist.

The vision behind Community Builders is to bridge the gap between Outreach Programs that need fulfillment for upcoming events and volunteers that are ready to serve.
